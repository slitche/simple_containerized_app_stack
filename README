#   This is a sample containerized (Docker - compose) stack deployed in a single host/VM via AWS X Terraform
#   Intergration testing was also included in the implementation.
#   
#   Stacks used: 
#   1. App server (python)
#   2. rabbitmq (message queue|broker)
#   3. PostgreSQL (database)
#   4. redis (caching)
#
#   
#   Tools:
#   1. Terraform (Infra provisioning)
#   2. Docker   (containerization)
#   3. AWS (VM | platform)
#   4. Github Actions (Workflow)
#
#
#   Process:
#   github actions -> Terraform -> AWS EC2 -> Docker
#   1. Workflow will be managed by github actions. Variables required by terraform will be supplied/defined
#   in github
#   2. Environment variables needed by the containers will be created/defined in the workflow using github secrets.
#   3. From the runner, we'll upload (via Terraform provisioner) needed files to the VM created via Terraform.
#   4. Docker related commands to provision the containers will be executed by Terraform as well. 
#   4. After the upload, we'll update the instance's security group to remove the ingress rule which allows the runner's IP to upload files in the host (for extra security).
